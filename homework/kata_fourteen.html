      <h1>Kata Fourteen: Tom Swift Under Milk Wood</h1>
    </hgroup>
    <article class="">
      <p>Adapted from Dave Thomas's work:</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://codekata.com/kata/kata14-tom-swift-under-the-milkwood/">http://codekata.com/kata/kata14-tom-swift-under-the-milkwood/</a></p>
<p>Trigrams can be used to mutate text into new, surreal, forms. But what
heuristics do we apply to get a reasonable result?</p>
<p>As a boy, one of my treats was go to the shops on a Saturday and spend part
of my allowance on books; for a nine-year old, I had quite a collection of
Tom Swift and Hardy Boys. Wouldn’t it be great to be able to create
more and more of these classic books, to be able to generate a new Tom
Swift adventure on demand?</p>
<p>OK, perhaps not. But that won’t stop us trying. I coded up a quick
program to generate some swash-buckling scientific adventure on demand. It
came up with:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>... it was in the wind that was what he thought was his companion. I
think would be a good one and accordingly the ship their situation
improved. Slowly so slowly that it beat the band! You’d think no one
was a low voice. &quot;Don’t take any of the elements and the
inventors of the little Frenchman in the enclosed car or cabin completely
fitted up in front of the gas in the house and wringing her hands.
&quot;I’m sure they’ll fall!&quot;

She looked up at them. He dug a mass of black vapor which it had
refused to accept any. As for Mr. Swift as if it goes too high I’ll
warn you and you can and swallow frequently. That will make the airship was
shooting upward again and just before the raid wouldn’t have been
instrumental in capturing the scoundrels right out of jail.&quot;&lt;/em&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Stylistically, it’s Victor Appleton meets Dylan Thomas. Technically,
it’s all done with trigrams.</p>
<p>Trigram analysis is very simple. Look at each set of three adjacent words
in a document. Use the first two words of the set as a key, and remember
the fact that the third word followed that key. Once you’ve finished,
you know the list of individual words that can follow each two word
sequence in the document. For example, given the input:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>I wish I may I wish I might
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You might generate:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>&quot;I wish&quot; =&gt; [&quot;I&quot;, &quot;I&quot;]
&quot;wish I&quot; =&gt; [&quot;may&quot;, &quot;might&quot;]
&quot;may I&quot;  =&gt; [&quot;wish&quot;]
&quot;I may&quot;  =&gt; [&quot;I&quot;]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This says that the words &quot;I wish&quot; are twice followed by the word
&quot;I&quot;, the words &quot;wish I&quot; are followed once by
&quot;may&quot; and once by &quot;might&quot; and so on.</p>
<p>To generate new text from this analysis, choose an arbitrary word pair as a
starting point. Use these to look up a random next word (using the table
above) and append this new word to the text so far. This now gives you a
new word pair at the end of the text, so look up a potential next word
based on these. Add this to the list, and so on. In the previous example,
we could start with &quot;I may&quot;. The only possible next word is
&quot;I&quot;, so now we have:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>I may I
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The last two words are &quot;may I&quot;, so the next word is &quot;wish&quot;. We then look up &quot;I
wish&quot;, and find our choice is constrained to another &quot;I&quot;.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>I may I wish I
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we look up &quot;wish I&quot;, and find we have a choice. Let’s
choose &quot;may&quot;:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>I may I wish I may
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Now we’re back where we started from, with &quot;I may.&quot; Following the same
sequence, but choosing &quot;might&quot; this time, we get:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>I may I wish I may I wish I might
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point we stop, as no sequence starts &quot;I might.&quot;</p>
<p>Given a short input text, the algorithm isn’t too interesting. Feed
it a book, however, and you give it more options, so the resulting output
can be surprising.</p>
<p>For this kata, try implementing a trigram algorithm that generates a couple
of hundred words of text using a book-sized file as input.
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a> is a good source of online
books (Tom Swift and His Airship is <a class="reference external" href="http://sailor.gutenberg.org/etext02/03tom10.txt">here</a>.)</p>
<p>Be warned that these files have DOS line endings (carriage return followed by
newline).</p>
<p>There is a copy of sherlock holmes right here:</p>
<p><a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/sherlock.txt"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">sherlock.txt</span></tt></a>.</p>
<p>And a shorter copy for testing:</p>
<p><a class="reference download internal" href="../_downloads/sherlock_small.txt"><tt class="xref download docutils literal"><span class="pre">sherlock_small.txt</span></tt></a>.</p>

    <article class="">
      <p>Kata’s are about trying something many times. In this one, what
we’re experimenting with is not just the code, but the heuristics of
processing the text. What do we do with punctuation? Paragraphs? Do we have
to implement backtracking if we chose a next word that turns out to be a
dead end?</p>
<p>I’ll fire the signal and the fun will commence...</p>
